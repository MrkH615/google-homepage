HTML/CSS project for The Odin Project - Web Development 101
Made on a 13-inch MacBook Air and viewed in Firefox.  

What I've learned:

1.  Practice concepts as I learn them
2.  Be prepared to change or discard my ideas about how to do something.
3.  Test the effect of making small changes with the browser developer tools.
4.  Try out snippet of code on jsfiddle.
5.  Ask for help and also be prepared to figure things out on my own.
6.  Be more concise in communicating when asking for help.
